    <li><h3>API stands for Application Programming Interface.</h3></li><li><h3>API is a mechanism that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.</h3>
        <p>For eg:the weather bureau's software system contains daily weather data.</p>
        <li><h3>API works usually in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. </h3></li>

    <li><h3>JSON stands for a JavaScript Object Notation.</h3></li>
    <li><h3>JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
</h3></li>
<li><h3>JSON is often used when the data is sent from a server to a web page.</h3></li>
<li><h3>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) API is an application programming interface designed for lightweight data interchange (text-based data exchange format) between two computer applications operating on the same hardware device or between different computers in different geographical areas.</h3></li>
<li><h3>The user and the server send a data request in the API. The API then designates how the data will be called using the GET method and the affiliated links shared.</h3></li>

    <h1>Drive Principle in JS: </h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>The driver principle in JavaScript is a design principle that states that a function should only have one reason to change. This means that a function should only be responsible for a single task, and that task should be well-defined and cohesive. </h3></li>
        <li><h3> It is used to reduce the amount of code that is repeated in a program .</h3></li>
         <li><h3> It is based on the idea that if a piece of code that can be reused, it shouldbe rather than being written again. </h3> </li>
         <li><h3>The driver principle is important because it helps to keep code clean, maintainable, and extensible. When a function has only one reason to change, it is easier to understand and to modify. This is especially important in large codebases, where it can be difficult to track down the source of a bug.</h3> </li>
